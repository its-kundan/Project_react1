- clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/its-kundan/Project_react1.git`

 ##  This Application I practices 

  1. ***Counter Project*** ( using hooks -> useState,) -> Background changer project.
  2. **Cards Scroller Project** ( horizontally scrolling) -> cards with array pass.
  3. **Timeline** -> make horizontal and vertical scrolling beautiful timelenes.


#### My Learning | Personal Documentation | to-do-list

1. .eslintrc -> used for optimization the react
2. package.json is the entry point of any project. 
3. use tailwind css for styling.
4. vite not install unnecessary dependencies like `create-react-app`.
5. module css is used for styling seperate components. css is global but module is not.
